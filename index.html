    <h1>Hello, user. Play with my dogs.</h1>
    <h2>By Alcino N. Donadel</h2>
    <p> Here are my dogs. Shadow tends to shrug away from a lot of attention. Spot is active. If you try to pet him, he's going to want to play, and he'll start running. Play nicely with my dogs, please. </p>

  <div>
    <img src="images/shy_dog.jpg" alt="Shy dog photo.">
    <img class="no" src="images/shy_dog.jpg" alt="Shy dog photo.">
  </div>
  <p>I used an event to hide my original image when the user clicks the image, thus displaying the same one with a lower opacity. It's to show you that this floof gets shy.</p>

  <p>Look how shifty he is! In this example, I am removing the original image when someone's mouse even attempts to touch Spot. The event then adds the same image but shifted downward, altered by different padding. </p>
